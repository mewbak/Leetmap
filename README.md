## Problem Solving using C++

###Some nomenclature
- A substring of a string S is another string S' that occurs "in" S. For example, "the best of" is a substring of "It was the best of times". This is not to be confused with subsequence, which is a generalization of substring. For example, "Itwastimes" is a subsequence of "It was the best of times", but not a substring.
