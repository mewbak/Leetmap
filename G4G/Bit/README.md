1. Binary representation of a given number [binRep.cpp](https://github.com/sdasgup3/CodingPuzzles/blob/master/G4G/Bit/binRep.cpp)
  * Write a program to print Binary representation of a given number.

Find the element that appears once
Given an array where every element occurs three times, except one element which occurs only once. Find the element that occurs once. Expected time complexity is O(n) and O(1) extra space.

Detect if two integers have opposite signs
Given two signed integers, write a function that returns true if the signs of given integers are different, otherwise false.

Count total set bits in all numbers from 1 to n
Given a positive integer n, count the total number of set bits in binary representation of all numbers from 1 to n.

Swap bits in a given number
Given a number x and two positions (from right side) in binary representation of x, write a function that swaps n bits at given two positions and returns the result.

Add two numbers without using arithmetic operators
Write a function Add() that returns sum of two integers. The function should not use any of the arithmetic operators (+, ++, –, -, .. etc).

Smallest of three integers without comparison operators
Write a C program to find the smallest of three integers, without using any of the comparison operators.

A Boolean Array Puzzle
Input: A array arr[] of two elements having value 0 and 1 Output: Make both elements 0.

Program to count number of set bits in an (big) array
Given an integer array of length N (an arbitrarily large number). How to count number of set bits in the array?

Next higher number with same number of set bits
Given a number x, find next number with same number of 1 bits in it’s binary representation.

Optimization Techniques | Set 1 (Modulus)
Modulus operator is costly. The modulus operator (%) in various languages is costly operation. Ultimately every operator/operation must result in processor instructions. Some processors won’t have modulus instruction at hardware level, in such case the compilers will insert stubs (predefined functions) to perform modulus.

Add 1 to a given number
Write a program to add one to a given number. You are not allowed to use operators like ‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘++’, ‘–‘ …etc.

Multiply a given Integer with 3.
Given a integer x, write a function that multiplies x with 3.5 and returns the integer result. You are not allowed to use %, /, *.

Turn off the rightmost set bit
Write a C function that unsets the rightmost set bit of an integer.

Find whether a given number is a power of 4 or not
Asked by Ajay 1. A simple method is to take log of the given number on base 4, and if we get an integer then number is power of 4.

Compute the integer absolute value (abs) without branching
We need not to do anything if a number is positive. We want to change only negative numbers. Since negative numbers are stored in 2’s complement form, to get the absolute value of a negative number we have to toggle bits of the number and add 1 to the result.

Compute modulus division by a power-of-2-number
Compute n modulo d without division(/) and modulo(%) operators, where d is a power of 2 number.

Compute the minimum or maximum of two integers without branching
On some rare machines where branching is expensive, the below obvious approach to find minimum can be slow as it uses branching.

Rotate bits of a number
Bit Rotation: A rotation (or circular shift) is an operation similar to shift except that the bits that fall off at one end are put back to the other end.

Find the two non-repeating elements in an array of repeating elements
